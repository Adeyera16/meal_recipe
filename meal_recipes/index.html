        <h1>POUNDED YAM</h1>
    <p>Pounded Yam is a staple in many West African homes, but it is not usually eaten by itself, it is often paired with many delicious African soups, and stews like Egusi, okra soup, Jute leaves soup (Ewedu), or Stewed Spinach (Efo Riro).Pounded yam is quite similar to mashed potatoes but it has a more doughy consistency. It belongs to a group of food we refer to as swallow because of the way we eat it. We cut out a morsel from the meal,  then we form an indentation on it with the thumb. Then, we scoop some stew or soup over it and we eat it.</p>
